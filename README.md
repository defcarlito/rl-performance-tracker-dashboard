## Overview

This site displays the data collected by the my [StatExtract](https://github.com/defcarlito/StatExtract) plugin. I have a server that takes in the data from my plugin and uploads it to a database from which this site accesses. 
## Usage

~~Access a live of demo of the site [here]().~~

I am unable to provide link to the live demo of the site at this time. Instead, view the following gif of me breifly using the app below:

The filter options are a bit limited right now, I plan to add more in the future. You may either filter by limit *or* by date. The log in the middle of the site shows all the matches as a result from the filter. Click show details to view match stats and some other information about that match. The graphs on the right showcase my MMR change over `n` days, where `n` is the number of matches resulted from the filter.
